# White House Budget Donut Visualisation
A donut visualisation of White House Budget. This project was initally started at [Gov Tech Hack](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/gov-tech-hack-by-the-people-for-the-people-tickets-16135863803).

Interesting note: how to visualize negative values in a pie chart? It's rather difficult, instead I chose to use a modified donut chart with each segment having the same width, but the height be depend on the value. Positive pushed the border outward, negative pushed the border inwards.

Use: D3.js
