#Next Steps:
* Create animation where heights of the bars change how the budget has evolved over the years
* Add input to change the years temporarily
* Find the best way to use a sunburst chart with the way the data is currently structured? Consider going that direction
* Or when click on a portion, it expands into more options, shifting the entire pie chart

##Todo:
* Find a better way to unite the budget and refData array, and how they access it each other, etc
* Optimisation in terms of smoothness ->  currrently lags to an extent
 * use canvas instead?


##Curiosities
* Try to turn into a isotype?
* For example try to use circles?
